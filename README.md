# SQL Project - Database Testing

![cover](resources/images/cover.jpg)

## Background

For this project, we will use six csv files with information about both former and current employees in a company to create an unified dataset and retrieve specific details about them in a simple manner. 

## Objective

Design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and perform basic queries with the data. The main tasks involve:

   * Data Modeling

   * Data Engineering

   * Data Analysis
   
## Basic Methodology

  #### Data Modeling

  Sketched out an entity relational diagram (ERD) of the tables to identify strategies for combining information effectively.
  
  #### Data Engineering

  Created a script to generate database and specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.  Refer to "schema.sql" file in the "resources" section.

  #### Data Analysis

  Test the accuracy of the database by performing various queries. Refer to "basic_queries.sql" file in the "resources" section.

## Overview

The capture above shows a partial view of the workbook. Notice a command button called "Start" has been created to run the script for all spreadsheets.

Finally, the last capture displays the requirements described on the "Basic Methodology" section. 

## Conclusion 

The app works as intended and runs efficiently with only one script! A possible follow-up to this project could include more features such as graphs to track open and close prices, total stock volume, and percentage increase or decrease over a period of the time.
