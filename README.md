# SQL - Database Testing

![cover](resources/images/cover.jpg)

## Background

We used six csv files with information about both former and current employees in a company to create an unified dataset and retrieve specific details about them in a simple manner. 

## Objective

Design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and perform basic queries with the data. The main tasks involve:

   * Data Modeling

   * Data Engineering

   * Data Analysis
   
## Basic Methodology & Overview

  #### Data Modeling

  Sketched out an entity relational diagram (ERD) of the tables to identify strategies for combining information effectively.
  
  #### Data Engineering

  Created a script to generate database and specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.  Refer to "schema.sql" file in the "resources" section.

  #### Data Analysis

  Test the accuracy of the database by performing various queries. Refer to "basic_queries.sql" file in the "resources" section.

## Conclusion 

The app works as intended! A possible follow-up to this project could include charting the dataset in R or Tableau to produce insights on employee salaries based on parameters such as department, manager, and seniority or even summarize information based on demographics which can potentially provide valuable insights about the company's workforce.
